# Maui (GPL)

### Summary

Maui automatically identifies main topics in text documents. Depending on the task, topics are tags, keywords, keyphrases, vocabulary terms, descriptors, index terms or titles of Wikipedia articles.

### Demo

There used to be a live demo, but that has since stopped working.

### Maui performs the following tasks:

* term assignment with a controlled vocabulary (or thesaurus)
* subject indexing
* keyphrase extraction
* terminology extraction
* automatic tagging
* concept extraction

It can also be used for terminology extraction and semi-automatic topic indexing.
